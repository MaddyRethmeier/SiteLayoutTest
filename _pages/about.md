At Welding Technology we study the system Material – Component – Welding Process utilizing a holistic approach and with a special attention to state-of-the-art welding processes.

Our particular expertise with regards to the complex interaction of the welding process and joined material does contribute to the safety of welded components by the transfer of knowledge to industrial practise.

We employ electric arc, laser, and laser-arc hybrid welding processes where high-power laser beam welding of thick walled structures is a special focus of our research.

The evaluation and prevention of weld-related fractures is a core topic in our research and we employ experimental set-ups at laboratory scale supplemented by numerical simulations for the systematic investigation of such defects.
